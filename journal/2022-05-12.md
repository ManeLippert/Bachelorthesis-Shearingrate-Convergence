# Discussion about Resolution

#### Thursday 24.03.2022 from 14:00 to 14:25 with Florian Rath and Arthur Peeters

### Minimum Values

WIP so we will try to find the best minimum resolution

* ```N_s_grid``` = 12
* ```N_vpar_grid``` = 16 or 32
* ```N_mu_grid``` = 6

Numeric dissipation gains with smaller scales of resolution that could cause the **lost** of zonal flows

### ```Python``` Program

* Write ```python``` program to evaluate the ```xy_phi``` diagnostics and symbolize 'Scherrrate' and heat flux
* Learn how to evaluate ```h5``` files
