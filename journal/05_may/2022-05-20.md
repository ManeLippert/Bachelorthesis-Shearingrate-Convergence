# Discussion about evaluation of the shearing rate

#### Friday 20.05.2022 12:00 to 12:15 with Florian Rath and Arthur Peeters

## Coordinate

The coordinate ```x``` is in the ```h5```-file marked as ```xphi``` and is the radial coordinate

## Derivative

The derivative is periodic which means that at the start point $f_0$ the other two points for derivative would be $f_{N}$ and $f_1$ and at the end point $f_{N}$ the other two points would be $f_{N-1}$ and $f_0$.\
\
That concludes to the formula:\
\
Start: $\frac{f_1 - 2 \cdot f_0 + f_N}{h^2}$\
\
Middle: $\frac{f_{i+1} - 2 \cdot f_i + f_{i-1}}{h^2}$\
\
End: $\frac{f_{0} - 2 \cdot f_N + f_{N-1}}{h^2}$

## Additional Diagnostic

Use fourier spetrum as additional diagnostic to evaluate the shearing rate $\omega_{\mathrm{E \times B}}$ like in Fig 5a in [[1]](../literature/Peeters%2C%20Rath%2C%20Buchholz%20-%20Gradient-driven%20flux-tube%20simulations%20of%20ion%20temperature%20gradient%20turbulence%20close%20to%20the%20non-linear%20threshold%20(Paper%2C%202016).pdf)
