# Start with Bachelor Work

#### Thursday 24.03.2022 from 14:00 to 14:27 with Florian Rath and Arthur Peeters

### Discussion on how to run the code:

#### Login:

* Login on local machine through ```x2go``` because ```ssh``` is too slow. 
* When someone uses login through ```ssh``` the command line is shrunk down to a limited amount of executables that results in no ```make``` command. To get full access to the command line one has too ```ssh``` to ```bpptx```

#### Cluster:

* ```btrzx1``` is easier to run code 
* ```btrzx3``` could cause problems with the nodes but is more efficient than ```btrzx1```

Run code first on ```btrzx1``` with [```bashrc_btrzx1```](/gkw/run_btrzx1/bashrc_btrzx1) (loads all modules for ```GKW```) with jobmanager ```SLURM``` (started with ```sbatch```) and jobscript [```jobscript_btrzx1_simple```](/gkw/run_btrzx1/jobscript_btrzx1_simple).

#### Sync Files:

From local to remote machine
```
scp -r Dokumente/Bachelorthesis-ZonalFlows/gkw/ bt712347@btrzx1-2.rz.uni-bayreuth.de:gkw/
```
From remote to local
```
scp -r bt712347@btrzx1-2.rz.uni-bayreuth.de:gkw/ Dokumente/Bachelorthesis-ZonalFlows/gkw/ 
```

on Linux account just use ```git``` protocol

### What to do first:

* Use test cases with adiabatic electrons
* Work with spectral and non-spectral (cheaper, but steps in heat production not reproducible) and compare the time duration
* In [paper](/literature/Peeters%2C%20Rath%2C%20Buchholz%20-%20Comparison%20of%20gradient%20and%20flux%20driven%20gyro-%0Akinetic%20turbulent%20transport%20(Paper%2C%202016).pdf) they used spectral 
* Compare spectral outcome with [paper](/literature/Peeters%2C%20Rath%2C%20Buchholz%20-%20Comparison%20of%20gradient%20and%20flux%20driven%20gyro-%0Akinetic%20turbulent%20transport%20(Paper%2C%202016).pdf)
* Verify the decrease of turbulence and heat flux on work point (condition of this bachelor thesis)
