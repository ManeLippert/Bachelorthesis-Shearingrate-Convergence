## Meeting with Florian Rath and Arthur Peeters

### Discussion how to begin the work for bachelor thesis:

* Start with reproduction of result in [paper](/bibliography/Peeters%2C%20Rath%2C%20Buchholz%20-%20Gradient-driven%20flux-tube%20simulations%20of%20ion%20temperature%20gradient%20turbulence%20close%20to%20the%20non-linear%20threshold%20(Paper%2C%202016).pdf) with help of [gkw](/gkw/)
* Because of the long runtime of the code firstly we will look only in one direction in the velocity space
* After that small steps in all direction for better understanding of the structure and to find minimal resolution for the best results 
* Furthermore increase box size and search for convergence of the wavelength in zonal flows
* There will be interpretation needed to clarify simplification steps in code

### Thesis
* Work in English or German > will do it in English
* Continues writing is better than everything in the end
