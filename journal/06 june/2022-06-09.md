# Meeting to increase Boxsize

#### Thursday 09.06.2022 14:00 to 14:30 with Florian Rath and Arthur Peeters

## Change Timestep
Set ```dtim = 0.02``` to ```dtim = 0.025``` and compare outcome with $\delta t$. The graph should decrease vor ```dtim```.
```dtim``` is a timestep measured with gkw.

## Final Resolution

```Nsgrid = 16```, ```Nvpar = 48```, ```Nmugrid = 9```

## Increase Boxsize

Change following variables according to increase factor $N$:

* ```ikx_space``` $ 5 \cdot N$
* ```nx``` = $[($ ```nx_old``` $ -1) \cdot N] +1$
