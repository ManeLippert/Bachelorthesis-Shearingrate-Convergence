# Resolution, Folder Structure and Comparison of Resolution

#### Wednesday 08.06.2022

## Resolution

Best resolution: 

```Nsgrid = 16```, ```Nvpar = 48```, ```Nmugrid = 9```

Possible Variations: 

* ```krhomax = 0.70 | nmod = 11```
* ```krhomax = 1.05 | nmod = 16```
* ```nx = 63```, ```nx = 43```

## New Folder Structure

Every change in ```input.dat``` gets it own folder and the evaluation notebook write changes in picture name. Furthermore the notebook will write with python the picture folder.

## Comparison of Resolution

* ```Nsgrid = 12/16``` | ```Nvpargrid = 64```, ```Nmugrid = 9``` | ```Nvpargrid = 48```, ```Nmugrid = 9```
* ```Nvpargrid = 64/48/32/16``` | ```Nsgrid = 16```, ```Nmugrid = 9``` 
* ```Nmugrid = 6/9``` | ```Nvpargrid = 64```, ```Nsgrid = 16``` | ```Nvpargrid = 48```, ```Nsgrid = 16```
