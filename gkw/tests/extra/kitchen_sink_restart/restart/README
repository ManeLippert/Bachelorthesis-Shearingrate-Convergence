This test is designed to tests the restart file writing and reading 

It reads the FDS written by the previous test case diag_kitchen_sink
via soft link to the 16 procs output - both tests must run together

To use, do:
cd tests
gkw_run_tests.pl diag_kitchen_sink*

Wait for the second test to finish.
If the resstart is sucessful, the second test will pass
using the (non-binary) reference files checked in here

NOTE: The SUMMARY of the test scripts always presently says all tests passed!
Look at the per file diff info!

Limitations
 Does not test the FDS output write on 1 proc
 (to do that alter the softlink yourself)
