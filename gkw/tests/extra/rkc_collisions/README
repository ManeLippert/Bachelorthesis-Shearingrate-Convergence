Demonstration of apparent improved stability in a case where the
timestep is limited by collisions. meth=2 is only stable up to
2x the maximum timestep estimate, whereas the 4-stage
scheme used here seems stable above 6x the maximum timestep
estimate. The 6 or 7 stage scheme enables one to increase
the collisionality while keeping the timestep fixed, so that
the timestep is more than 10x the maximum estimate.

In the rkfiles subdirectory are parameters that should appear
at the start of the input file for the different schemes.
The schemes are meth=-4,-6,-7, where abs(meth) is the number
of stages. This scheme can have any number of stages, but
only 3 are given here.
