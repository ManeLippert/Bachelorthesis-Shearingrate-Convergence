The input files and matlab script here were used to create the figure with r2645 of the code.
Better agreement might be obtained with larger gridsizes and less dissipation, perhaps using the arakawa scheme

Could also be rerun to see if the matrix conditioning fix of r2904 makes any difference to this result
