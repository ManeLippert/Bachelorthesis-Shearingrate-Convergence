These input files were used to generate the figure with revision 2657 of the
code.  The case is the Waltz GA-STD case with adiabatic electrons, electostatic.

Results are close, but as with the ETG case, the values are slightly lower for 
non-spectral than spectral.  Results for both schemes are well converged in NX, 
and the other grids are identical.

It can be seen that the growth rates in the linear phase of non-spectral case 
are slightly less, so the difference is probably not in the non-linearity, but 
in the dissipation settings (whilst the values used are the same, disp_x is 
likely not equivalent in magnitude in the two schemes).  Comparing to GYRO 
(which is also non-spectral) we previously found that GYRO gave an ion
diffusivity of 3.5 (gyro-bohm units) and the two codes could be made closer 
by matching dissipation (see F.J.Casson thesis).

Equally one might attribute the difference to the higher zonal flow in the
non-spectral case: There are slightly larger non-spectral RH residuals in the 
zonal benchmark.
