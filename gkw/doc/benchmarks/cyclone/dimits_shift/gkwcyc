Nonlinear cyclone base case GKW
First column R/LT 
Second column chi in gyro-Bohm units rho_i^2 v_th / L_N where v_th = sqrt(T/m), i.e. 
  same units as Dimits. 
Third column error (only from averaging, not from grid convergence (still needs to 
  be done) Grid 21 Toroidal modes (all positive) 83 Radial modes (64*128 in real 
  space) 8 mu points, 32 parallel velocity, 16 points along field line.
