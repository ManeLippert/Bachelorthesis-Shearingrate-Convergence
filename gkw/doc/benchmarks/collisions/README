Graphs for tests of conservation / convergence properties of collision operator
(Test not benchmark)

The inputs for the benchmark of collisions in Peeters PoP 2009 (self-consistent mode structure paper) 
should be found / recreated in due course.

A more thorough benchmark of the pitch angle part of the collisions is in ../collisions_tem
