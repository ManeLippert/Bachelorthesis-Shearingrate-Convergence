Linear benchmark of the Cyclone case 

input files of GKW: gyg51 gyg52 gyg53 gyg54 gyg55 gyg56
results (from GKW r2876) are given in gyg5 

One can run runme.m to produce the figures 

NOTE: the GENE and GYGLES results have been read of from 
a figure in [T. Goerler, CPC  Journal of Computational Physics 230 (2011) 7053â€“7071
i.e. the accuracy could be improved.
