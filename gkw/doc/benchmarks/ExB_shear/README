The initial ExB shear benchmark is documented in Casson et al, Physics of Plasmas, 16, 092303 (2009)

The input files here can be used to recreate the GKW benchmarks with GYRO (Waltz case without parallel shear) 
and GS2 (Cyclone case with parallel shear).  Both sets of input files switch on the ExB shear after the 
nonlinear phase is reached to acess the self sustained turbulence. 
Both sets of input files here have improved dissipation settings from the original benchmark figures.

The data in the .dat files is the non GKW data taken from the papers with which the benchmarks were made:
GYRO data: Kinsey et Al, Physics of Plasmas, 12, 062302 (2005)
GS2 data: Roach et Al, Plasma Physics and controlled Fusion, 51, 124020 (2009)

Some investigations with GKW to try and improve the agreement of the ExB shear benchmark 
were undertaken after the above paper was published which can be found in the PDF
in this directory. It was found that the critical shear region (where fluxes drop to zero) 
was very sensitive to radial dissipation (of which GKW usually has none). 
When radial dissipation was added in GKW, the critical shear point reduced.  
Parallel dissipation was found to allow nonphysical turbulence to persist at high shear.
Exact correspondence between the codes was difficult to achieve due to the different grids in the two codes.

The nonperiodic boundary condition in GYRO gives an almost identical result
to the periodic boundary at zero ExB shear, but at nonzero shear with damped boundaries
the radial box size convergence could also be tested.  F.J.Casson thanks W. Guttenfelder for doing the GYRO runs.
