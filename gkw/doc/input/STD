!This GKW input file replicates the adiabatic standard case of GYRO in the paper
!"Nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence simulations of E x B shear quenching of transport"
!Kinsey, Waltz and Candy, Physics of Plasmas 12, 062302 (2005)

!To compare energy fluxes divide by 9.5 from GKW fluxes output col 2
!To compare time units multiply GKW time by 3/sqrt(2) 
!Further details of normalization conversion to gyro-bohm units in CPC paper.

!Fluxes output is comparable to the published result for same gridsizes.
!The case is not converged for nmod or vpar.
!The case is converged for nx, lx, timestep and dissipation.
!ns, nmu not convergence tested.

!Recommend at least 16 processors, 32 better.
