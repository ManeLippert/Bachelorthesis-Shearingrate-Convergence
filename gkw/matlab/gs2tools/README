This folder contains some tools for modifying gs2 input files and batch
launching gs2 runs (analagous to the gkw tools). 
It also contains tools for converting inputs between gkw and gs2.

These tools can be useful for linear benchmarks of the two codes, but are 
unfinished works in progress and should therefore be USED WITH CARE
(you need an understanding of the input parameters of both codes and should 
do your own checks on the resulting files !)

These routines and template files work with the old sourceforge download of gs2 [1]
The routines with an additional "c" in the name (make_cgs2input / read_gs2outputc) 
refer to the GS2 code modified with the addition of Coriolis force by C. Angioni.  
The only input difference in the Coriolis version is the appearance of the species 
upara parameters (remove it if you want to use the original gs2)

The input file format of new gs2 obtainable from the new svn repository [2]
has changed a little from the old sourceforge download [1].  The script
gs2_old2new removes some of the parameters that are no longer allowed but
it is not guaranteed that the files will still run correctly, or that the
outputs will still be readable by the scripts here.

The original set of gs2mattools were developed by A. G. Peeters and C. Angioni
and were actually the original inspiration for the GKW matlab tools found in the 
folder above.  For historical purposes, the original (more complete set) of the 
gs2mattools corresponding to the original GS2 [1] can be found in the tarball.
