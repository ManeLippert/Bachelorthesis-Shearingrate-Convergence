This file attempts to document the chronology of major enhancements to GKW, as
identified through sometimes infrequent incrementally numbered tagged
versions. It is only an overview, many other things have been improved / fixed /
added which may not be captured here (feel free to expand where something is
missed). Tagged versions from 0.3-b2 onwards should be stable and well tested.

2016-02-11: gkw-0.4-b1
   First version with the new project name:
   GKW is now the acronym of 'Gyrokinetic Workshop'
    - support for new SLEPc/PETSc library version
    - an interface to read an equilibrium computed with the NEO code
    - an interface to read experimental profiles
    - numerous fixes and improvements, in particular of diagnostics and IO

2015-04-16: gkw-0.3-b2
   First tagged version in git (bitbucket) after transfer from googlecode SVN.  
   The main advance is rewritten diagnostics and IO, including HDF5
   functionality.  Most output files can still be produced in the legacy format
   by using io_legacy = T. 
   - HDF5 output option
   - New diagnostics for energetics, non-linearity, linear drive and more
   - Integrated build of UMFPACK libraries
   - Alternative form of the conservative collision operator (Z. Lin PoP 1995)
   - Test cases and script now test nearly all diagnostics 
   - Use of git and branches.  After this version, the master branch should be
     less frequently updated, and only with stable and well tested versions.

2014-10-02: gkw-0.3-b1-pre-hdf5
   Last version before a major rewrite & cleanup of IO and diagnostics. 
   A long time since the last tagged version, includes
   - Fully functional and benchmarked global (and radially non-spectral) version
   - Parallelized in radial direction (non-spectral only), scales to 64k cores
   - Miller geometry, slab geometry
   - Eigenvalue solver
   - Imposed islands in non spectral versions (and imposed island in 2D)
   - Self consistent islands in global version
   - Poloidal asymmetries from anisotropic minority species
   - Parallel derivatives of order rho*
   - Modulated source

2012-01-20: gkw-0.2-b2-separate-geoms
   The last version before a rewrite of the geometry to a more general form. 
   Includes a first functional version of the non spectral scheme.
 
2011-11-11: gkw-0.2-b1-flux-tube
   The last flux-tube only version of GKW.  MANY things were added or improved
   since the CPC version, including:
   - Centrifugal force
   - Compressional magnetic field
   - Imposed magnetic islands
   - Circular geometry (X. Lappillonne PoP 09) 
   - OpenMP hybrid scheme (up to 4 threads, improves scaling with collisions)
   - Fully debugged conservative collision operator
   - Improved build, per-host configuration
   - Improved performance and reduced memory usage

The CPC branch was a cleaned up version of GKW corresponding to the 2009 CPC
paper, without experimental features.:

2010-11-23: gkw-0.1-b4
   Released as download on googlecode. As previous with:
   - Fix bug with non default vpmax and mumax inputs
   - Flag more known bugs in collision operator (adiabatic_electrons, en_scatter)

2010-09-30: gkw-0.1-b3
   Released as download on googlecode. As previous with:
   - Improve the sample linear input files to run stable converged cases
   - Flag known bugs in collision operator (friction term, mom_conservation)
   - Flag known bug with non zero chin in general geometry
   - Fix bug in connect_parallel for mode_box with general geom with negative signB/J  

2010-03-19:  gkw-0.1-b2
   Released as download on googlecode. As previous with:
   - Bug fix for growing (0,0) mode in nonlinear kinetic runs. 
   - Fixed bug in the sort routine in matdat.  
   - Improved vectorisation performance in exp_integration RK routines.
   - Improved README file

2009-04-28: gkw-0.1-b1 (AEES_v1_0 in CPC library)
   First "stable" GKW release with CPC publication, cleaned up version of code.
