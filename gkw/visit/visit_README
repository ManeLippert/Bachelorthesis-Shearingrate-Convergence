The file Binaryconvertvtk.cpp is the code for converting the GKW 3D output to VTK files
compile with:
 [i/g]cc -lm -02 Binaryconvertvtk.cpp

Then run it in the folder with your data files.  
GKW outputs needed are 3D binary files + 3Doutputparam.dat
Run GKW with and den3d/ene3d/phi3d=.true.  Use at least 64 s points (128 is better) 
For nice movies, the time between output dumps should be ~0.2 in normalised units.

You may then be able to open the pre-exisitng visit.session files inside visit 
which contain some plot attrbuties 
Copy them first to the data folder, and run visit from that folder.

If that fails, open the data, plot the torusmesh (mesh plot) and toruspotential(psuedo-potential plot) 
and apply your own clip operators.
Adjust the lighting and annotations and mesh and potential attributes as you wish.

Use the Visit inbuilt function to generate a movie when all frames are loaded in the database.
If it fails at the final movie conversion stage, 
Try the movie.sh script or 
"ffmpeg -f image2 -r 20 -b 18600 -i  ./movie%04d.jpeg ./movie.mpeg"
To make the movie file from the jpegs.

Beware that producing a compressed movie that works on all players (quicktime / WMP) is nearly impossible.
mpeg-2 made with ffmpeg are usally portable, but often not more advanced mpeg-4 codecs
Should always be tested on a machine if used in talk.  Use VLC to be safe.
