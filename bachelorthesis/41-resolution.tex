\section{Variation of Computational Resolution}
\label{sec:variationsofresolution}

At the beginning of this work the goal is to estimate the minimal resolution needed to run the simulation without numerical dissipation biasing the physical outcome. Numerical dissipation can therefore result to no formation of zonal flow structures, which cause an permanent turbulent state of the simulation. The goal behind this testing is to reduce \textbf{calculation time} and \textbf{costs} of the simulation. \\
Because of that, the criteria for the best resolution should be:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[\textbf{(1)}] Subdued turbulence after \textbf{short} time periods
	\item[\textbf{(2)}] Stability for \textbf{long} time periods 
\end{enumerate}
and the following procedure will be applied for verification:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reduce only one number of grid points and look if criterias \textbf{(1), (2)} are satisfied
	\item Reduce to known minimum number of grid points to verify result in general.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Benchmark}
\label{sub:benchmark}

Starting from the \enquote{Standard resolution with 6th order (S6)} [Tab. \ref{tab:resolutionBenchmark}] the first step is to reproduce the result of Ref. \citenum{Peeters2016} in Section IV. Note that, because of selected circular concentric geometry the used inverse background temperature gradient length is $\rlt = 6.0$ instead of $\rlt = 7.0$ which was used in Section IV of Ref. \citenum{Peeters2016} for $s$-$\alpha$ geometry. In Fig. \ref{fig:eflux-ns16-nvpar64-nmu9} the obtained data is similar to the results from Ref. \citenum{Peeters2016} with subdued turbulence after $\sim 3000\,R/\vth$.

As next step to verify the selection of the gradient length $\rlt$ an approach to the finite heat flux threshold was made. As Ref. \citenum{Peeters2016} in Section V concludes the finite heat flux threshold is approximately located at a gradient length of $\rlt = 6.3$ for circular geometry [FIG. 4 of Ref. \citenum{Peeters2016}]. Therefore, following parameters were used
\begin{gather*}
	\rlt \in [6.0, 6.3]~.
\end{gather*}
As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:eflux-gradient-length} for $\rlt = 6.3$ no suppression of turbulence occurs in the whole time domain, which is in agreement with Ref. \citenum{Peeters2016}.

\subsection{Reduction of parallel Velocity Grid Points $\Nvpar$}
\label{sub:reduceNvpar}

In the following the number of grid points for the parallel velocity $\Nvpar$ is reduced to
\begin{gather*}
	\Nvpar \in [16, 32, 48, 64]~.
\end{gather*}
In Fig. \ref{fig:eflux-ns16-nvpar16-32-48-64-nmu9} is clearly visible that the resolution with $\Nvpar = 16$ is not suitable for criteria \textbf{(1)} because here the turbulence is not subdued after a long time period. But resolution $\Nvpar = 32$ is not acceptable as well according to criteria \textbf{(2)} since the suppressed turbulence state gain instability after $\sim 3000\,R/\vth$.\\
So to conclude only grid points with $\Nvpar = 48, 64$ are satisfying the set of criteria. Due to criteria \textbf{(1)} the selected resolution is
\begin{gather*}
	\boxed{\Nvpar = 48}~.
\end{gather*}
With this number of grid points the time until turbulence subdued is halfed compared to the benchmark case, i.e., turbulence suppression occur after $\sim 1500\,R/\vth$.

\subsection{Reduction of Magnetic Moment Grid Points $\Nmu$}
\label{sub:reduceNmu}

In the next step the number of grid points for the magnetic moment $\Nmu$ were reduced with
\begin{gather*}
	\Nmu \in [6, 9] ~.
\end{gather*}
As in Fig. \ref{fig:eflux-ns16-nvpar64-nmu6-9} shown, the reduction of grid points for the magnetic moment does not significantly impact the suppression of turbulence. The turbulence enters the stationary state in both cases after $\sim 3000\,R/\vth$.

	Time traces for reduced magnetic moment grid points $\Nmu$
}{fig:eflux-ns16-nvpar64-nmu6-9}{}

To conclude a final result the number of grid points for the parallel velocity got reduced to $\Nvpar = 48$ according to Chapter \ref{sub:reduceNvpar}. In this case the turbulence does not subdue for the resolution $\Nmu = 6$ which leads, with both criteria in mind, to the following resolution
\begin{gather*}
	\boxed{\Nmu = 9}~.
\end{gather*}

\subsection{Reduction Grid Points along of the Magnetic Field $\Ns$}
\label{sub:reduceNs}

In the final step the number of grid points along the magnetic field $\Ns$ gets reduced with the following parameters
\begin{gather*}
	\Ns \in [12, 16]~.
\end{gather*}
In Fig. \ref{fig:eflux-ns12-16-nvpar64-nmu9} can be seen that the reduction to $\Ns = 12$ does not satisfy the criteria \textbf{(2)} because the stationary state of the turbulence gets instabil after $\sim 2500\,R/\vth$. This concludes to the following resolution
\begin{gather*}
	\boxed{\Ns = 16}~.
\end{gather*}
