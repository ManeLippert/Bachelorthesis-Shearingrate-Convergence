    abstract = {Global gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven turbulence in an ideal MHD ITER equilibrium plasma are performed with the ORB5 code. The noise control and field-aligned Fourier filtering procedures implemented in ORB5 are essential in obtaining numerically healthy results with a reasonable amount of computational effort: typical simulations require 109 grid points, 109 particles and, despite a particle per cell ratio of unity, achieve a signal to noise ratio larger than 50. As compared with a circular concentric configuration with otherwise similar parameters (same ρ* = 1/720), the effective heat diffusivity is considerably reduced for the ITER MHD equilibrium. A self-organized radial structure appears, with long-lived zonal flows (ZF), modulating turbulence heat transport and resulting in a corrugated temperature gradient profile. The ratio of long-lived ZF to the fluctuating ZF is markedly higher for the ITER MHD equilibrium as compared with circular configurations, thereby producing a more effective ITG turbulence suppression, in spite of a higher linear growth rate. As a result, the nonlinear critical temperature gradient, R/LTcrit,NL, is about twice the linear critical temperature gradient, R/LTcrit,lin. Moreover, the heat transport stiffness above the nonlinear threshold is considerably reduced as compared with circular cases. Plasma elongation is probably one of the essential causes of this behaviour: indeed, undamped ZF residual levels and geodesic acoustic mode damping are both increasing with elongation. Other possible causes of the difference, such as magnetic shear profile effects, are also investigated.}

    abstract = {Flux-driven ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence and associated transport regulated by non-local and non-diffusive processes are investigated based on GKNET simulations in a global toroidal geometry. Among these processes, the instantaneous formation of radially extended quasi-coherent structure, which leads to the transport burst, is found to play an important role in causing global profile formation and relaxation. To elucidate the characteristics of such a transport process, we introduce the size probability distribution function (size-PDF)  to analyze heat flux eddies in the real space, with  the eddy size, incorporated with Fourier-based approaches in spectral space. In the size-PDF to the quiescent phase,  is found to be fitted by three piecewise power laws which transitions at two typical sizes,  and , as ,  , and , where  and  in squared gyro-radius unit  for the system with  (a: the minor radius). On the other hand, the size-PDF in the bursting phase exhibits non-power-law irregular humps which corresponds to the quasi-coherent structures for  reaching to . Such a coherent structure is ascribed to the spontaneous alignment of smaller scale eddies through phase matching in radial direction, which is classified as a quasi-deterministic process. Resultantly, a large amount of free energy is extracted from the system due to subsequent growth of the event, by which a self-organized profile is established. The coherent structure is then readily disintegrated by self-generated zonal flows, followed by the energy transferred to smaller eddies. Finally, turbulent transport in the steady state of a flux-driven system is found to be regulated by the mixture of such quasi-deterministic process and probabilistic processes, which leads to stiffness and resilience in the profile formation and self-similarity in the relaxation.}

    abstract = { We study the dynamics of turbulence transport subject to a constraint on the profile formation and relaxation, dominated by the ion temperature gradient modes, within the framework of adiabatic electron response using a flux-driven global gyro-kinetic toroidal code, GKNET. We observe exponentially constrained profiles, with two different scale lengths, that are spatially constant in each region in higher input power regimes. The profiles are smoothly connected in the knee region located at 1/2−2/3 of the minor radius, outside which the gradient is steepened and shows a weak confinement improvement. Based on the probability density function analysis of heat flux eddies, the power law demonstrates a dependence on the eddy size S, as P∼S−α, which distinguishes events into diffusive and non-diffusive parts including the validation of quasi-linear hypotheses. Radially localized avalanches and global bursts, which exhibit different spatial scales, play central roles in giving rise to constrained profiles on an equal footing. It is also found that the E×B shear layers are initiated by the global bursts, which evolve downward on a slow time scale across the knee region and play a role in adjusting the profile by increasing the gradient. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘H-mode transition and pedestal studies in fusion plasmas’. }
