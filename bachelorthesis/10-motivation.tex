Ion temperature gradient driven turbulence close to marginal stability exhibits zonal flow pattern formation on mesoscales, so-called $\exb$ staircase structures \cite{Pradalier2010}.
Such pattern formation has been observed in local gradient-driven flux-tube simulations \cite{Peeters2016, Weikl2017, Rath2021} as well as global gradient-driven \cite{McMillan2009, Villard2013, Seo2022} and global flux-driven \cite{Pradalier2010, Pradalier2015, Wang2020, Kim2022, Kishimoto2023} studies. 
In global studies, spanning a larger fraction of the minor radius, multiple radial repetitions of staircase structures are usually observed, with a typical pattern size of several ten Larmor radii.
% By contrast, the radial domain size of local flux-tube simulations is often restricted to a similar mesoscale.
By contrast, in the aforementioned local studies the radial size of $\exb$ staircase structures is always found to converge to the radial box size of the flux tube domain.
The above observations lead to the question: \bigskip


\textit{Does the basic pattern size always converges to the box size, or is there a typical mesoscale size inherent to staircase structures also in a local flux-tube description?}\bigskip

The latter case would imply that it is not necessarily global physics, i.e., profile effects, that set 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] the radial size of the $\exb$ staircase pattern
	\item[(ii)] the scale of avalanche-like transport events.
\end{itemize}
These transport events are usually restricted to $\exb$ staircase structures and considered as a nonlocal transport mechanism \cite{Pradalier2010}. \bigskip

In this bachlor thesis the above question is addressed through a box size convergence scan of the same cases close to the nonlinear threshold for turbulence generation as studied in Ref. \citenum{Peeters2016}.
