\section{Magnetic Confinement in Tokamak}
\label{sec:confinement}

In tokamak devices strong magnetic fields confine the hot plasma. As mentioned in Chapter \ref{sec:motion} a magnetic field forces a perpendicular particle motion and a motion which contains the gyro motion and slow perpendicular gyro center drifts. Because of the much smaller size of the Larmor radius compared to the device size $R$ the particle and energy losses are caused by the gyro center drift. To avoid additional loss of particles because of the parallel motion the field lines of the magnetic field in the tokamak devices is shaped like a torus. This type of geometry has nested surfaces with constant magnetic flux, so-called \textit{flux surfaces}, and magnetic field lines which lie on these surfaces. To maintain stability the magnetic field has a toroidal and a poloidal component. According to the force balance the magnetic field is equivalent to the plasma pressure which means on flux-surfaces the plasma pressure is constant. \cite{Stroth2011, Wesson2011} The toroidal component is produced by external coils whereas the poloidal component is provided by the toroidal plasma current. Together the components result in a magnetic field which follows helical trajectories [Fig \ref{fig:confinement}]. To characterize the quality of confinement the so-called \textit{plasma beta} is used and is given as
\begin{gather}
    \beta = \frac{nT}{\mu_0 B^2/2}~,
\end{gather} 
with $n$ the plasma density, $T$ as temperature, $\mu_0$ the permeability in vacuum and the magnetic field strength $B$. Respectively, the plasma beta compares the thermal plasma pressure $nT$ to the ambient magnetic field pressure $\mu_0 B^2/2$. For fusion devices the plasma beta has to be a bit smaller than 1 ($\beta < 1$) for optimal confinement. In a tokamak reactor the plasma beta has a typical order of a few percent. \cite{Wesson2011}
