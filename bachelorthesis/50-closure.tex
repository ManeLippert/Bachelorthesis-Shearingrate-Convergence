% what has been done
Through careful tests this brief communication confirms the radial size convergence of the $\exb$ staircase pattern in local gyrokinetic flux tube simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven turbulence.
% mention the scale explicitly, and also that it is the scale compliant to CBC parameters (for other plasma parameters it might differ)
A mesoscale pattern size of $\sim 57.20 - 76.27\,\rhoth$ is found to be intrinsic to ITG driven turbulence for Cyclone Base Case parameters.
% compare to other studies
This length scale is somewhat larger compared to results from global studies with finite $\rho_\ast$, which report of a few $10\,\rhoth$ \cite{pradalier2010}, and has to be considered the proper mesoscale in the local limit $\rho_\ast \rightarrow 0$.  
% relevance of the outcome
The occurrence of this mesoscale implies that non-locality, in terms of Ref. \cite{pradalier2010}, is inherent to ITG driven turbulence, since avalanches are spatially organized by the $\exb$ staircase pattern \cite{mcmillan2009, pradalier2010, rath2016, peeters2016}.
