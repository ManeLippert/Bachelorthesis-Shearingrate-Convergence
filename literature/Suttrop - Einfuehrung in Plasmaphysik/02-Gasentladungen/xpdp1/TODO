Bugfixes:

  Buffers not copied for string names in xpdp1.  Fixed 2-5-99 KC

Known Bugs:

	Not all input files are changed to work with current versions.
	implicit push will push particle out of bounds in pre-push.
	Incorrect injection from RHS.
	Incorrect thermal load in x with a drift.
	will not run correctly if build with double precision
	
Wish List:
	
	Kevin will optimize pdp1.
	set v to time center particles at t=0.
	rescale velocities so that k is not needed in the push (easy 5 minutes).
	A more flexible input file format.
