The  radial  size  convergence  of  the   E×B  staircase  pattern  is  adressed  in  local  gradient-driven  flux  tube  simulations  of  ion  temperature  gradient  (ITG)  driven  turbulence. Its  is  shown  that  a  mesoscale  pattern  size  of ∼57.20−76.27\rho is inherent to ITG driven turbulence with Cyclone Base Case parameters in the local limit. 
This case would imply that it is not necessarily global physics, i.e., profile effects, that set (i) the radial size of the  E×B staircase pattern and (ii) the scale of avalanche-like transport events.
Multiple box size convergence scans in radial, binormal and isotropic directions close to the nonlinear threshold for turbulence generation were performed with the non-linear flux tube version of Gyrokinetic Workshop (GKW).
