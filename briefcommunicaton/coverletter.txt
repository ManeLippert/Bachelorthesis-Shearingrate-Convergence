Ion temperature gradient driven turbulence (ITG) close to marginal stability exhibits zonal flow pattern formation on mesoscales, so-called E × B staircase structures. Such pattern formation has been observed in local gradient-driven flux-tube simulations as well as global gradient-driven and global flux-driven studies.

In global studies, spanning a larger fraction of the minor radius, multiple radial repetitions of staircase structures are usually observed, with a typical pattern size of several ten Larmor radii. By contrast, in previous local studies the radial size of E × B staircase structures converge to the radial box size of the flux tube domain. This leads to the question:

Does the basic pattern size always converges to the box size, or is there a typical mesoscale size inherent to staircase structures also in a local flux-tube description?

It is  shown by multiple box size convergence scans  that  a  mesoscale  pattern  size  of ∼57.20−76.27\rho is inherent to ITG driven turbulence with Cyclone Base Case parameters in the local limit. This outcome also implies that a typical scale for avalanche-like transport is inherent to ITG driven turbulence.
